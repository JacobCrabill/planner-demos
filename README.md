# Planning Demos in 2D

I needed a fun C++ coding project; I wanted to learn simple arcade-style graphics; and I wanted a framework to try out different path-planning algorithms.  This is the resultant WIP.

## To Build:

Dependencies (that I can think of):
- A modern C++ compiler (Supporting c++17 or newer)
- OpenGL
- make

You should be able to simply type:
```make```

## To Use

```bin/planner-demo```
